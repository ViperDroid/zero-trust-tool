Introduction üìñ
The Zero-Trust Cybersecurity Tool is a Python application designed to enhance cybersecurity by implementing a Zero-Trust Architecture. It uses blockchain technology to ensure tamper-proof logging of security events, real-time network monitoring to detect anomalies, and automated incident response to block suspicious activity.

This tool is ideal for:

Educational purposes

Cybersecurity research

Small-scale deployments

Features ‚ú®
Blockchain Integrity:

Tamper-proof logging of security events.

Real-Time Network Monitoring:

Detect anomalies using machine learning.

Automated Incident Response:

Block suspicious IPs using iptables.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):

Secure login with OTP (One-Time Password).

Quantum-Resistant Encryption:

Uses CRYSTALS-Kyber for post-quantum encryption.

User and Device Management:

Add/remove users and devices dynamically.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

Assign roles (e.g., admin, user) and restrict access.

Installation üõ†Ô∏è
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher.

pip (Python package manager).

Administrator/root access (for blocking IPs and running servers).
